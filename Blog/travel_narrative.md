# The Path of the Divine: A Journey to Jagannath's Abode

**December 22, 2023**

The air was crisp and cool as we began our pilgrimage, our hearts filled with a sense of anticipation and devotion. We arrived at the railway station at 4:05 AM, and as the train pulled away at 4:30 AM, we chanted "Jai Jagannath," our voices a whisper in the pre-dawn quiet.

The day was spent in transit, a blur of delicious masala dosas, lively games of Uno, and the comforting taste of a home-cooked meal. As the sun set, we settled in for the night, dreaming of the sacred city of Bhubaneswar, our first destination.

We arrived in Bhubaneswar, the "City of Temples," at 10:00 AM and, after a quick stop at our hotel, made our way to the magnificent Lingaraj Temple.

### The Lingaraj Temple: A Symphony in Stone

The Lingaraj Temple, a testament to the Kalinga architectural style, is a sight to behold. Its towering 180-foot Vimana pierces the sky, a beacon of faith for centuries. As we entered the sprawling complex, we were surrounded by over 150 smaller shrines, their walls adorned with intricate carvings that seemed to breathe life into the ancient stones.

The temple is dedicated to Harihara, a unique form of both Shiva and Vishnu, a symbol of the harmonious convergence of Shaivism and Vaishnavism. The main sanctum houses a Swayambhu (self-manifested) Shivalinga, which has been worshipped since the 7th century. We offered our prayers, feeling a deep sense of peace and connection to the divine.

We left the temple at 3:20 PM, our hearts full, and began our journey to the coastal town of Puri, the abode of Lord Jagannath.

### A Fortuitous Encounter

Our journey took an unexpected turn at the Netaji Birth Place Museum in Cuttack, the ancestral home of Subhas Chandra Bose. Here, amidst the relics of a great freedom fighter, we met a group of tourists from Bangladesh. A chance conversation led to a precious gift: the contact information of a pandit at the Puri Jagannath Temple. Little did we know that this encounter would be the key to the most profound experience of our lives.

The next day, we arrived at the Puri Jagannath Temple to a sea of humanity. The sheer number of devotees was overwhelming, and we realized it would take hours to even catch a glimpse of the Lord. Just as a sense of despair began to set in, we remembered the pandit's number. With a prayer on our lips, we made the call.

A young pandit was sent to guide us, and he led us through a labyrinth of ancient alleyways to a small office where we could safely deposit our belongings. As the temple's flag was being changed, a daily ritual of daring and devotion, we rushed to the west gate, the "Tiger Gate."

### The Darshan of a Lifetime

After a short wait in the VIP queue, we entered the temple complex. The pandit guided us to a small shrine dedicated to Lord Hanuman, and then, we were in the main sanctum. Our eyes were drawn to the divine trio on the Ratnabedi (bejeweled platform): the serene white face of Lord Balabhadra, the gentle smile of Subhadra Maa, and the captivating presence of Lord Jagannath.

We were ushered to a spot near the left wall, and for five glorious minutes, we had an uninterrupted view of the Lord. The world outside faded away, and we were lost in the divine aura of the deities.

After the darshan, the pandit guided us to the other shrines within the complex, sharing stories of their significance. He also explained the importance of not stepping on the "Yama Shila," a stone that is believed to absorb one's sins, but also nullify the benefits of the darshan.

Our experience was made even more special by the Maha Prasad, the sacred food offering from the temple's massive kitchen. The taste was otherworldly, a divine flavor that will forever be etched in our memories.

### A Journey Guided by Grace

As we left the temple, we reflected on the series of fortunate events that had led us to this moment. The chance encounter at the museum, the timely darshan, the unexpected Maha Prasad – it all felt like a divine orchestration.

Our journey also led us to the ancient Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves, where we marveled at the rock-cut shelters of Jain monks. And in a conversation with a wise man named Sri Haridas, we learned about the Kalki Avatar, the final incarnation of Lord Vishnu, a symbol of hope for a world in need of balance.

This pilgrimage was more than just a trip; it was a journey of faith, a series of miracles that reaffirmed our belief in the divine. It felt as though Lord Krishna himself had called us to his abode, guiding us every step of the way, and showering us with his grace.
