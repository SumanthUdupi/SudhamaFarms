### **Navigation & Header**

1. **Backdrop Blur:** Increase the `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` in the `.glassmorphism` class to `blur(20px)` for better text readability over the scrolling background.
2. **Scroll Shadow:** Add a subtle `shadow-sm` to the header only when the user has scrolled down, keeping it flat when at the very top.
3. **Active State Indicator:** Change the nav link active state from a simple underline to a "pill" shape background (soft beige) with the text color changing to `var(--green-color)` for higher contrast.
4. **Logo Size Transition:** Animate the logo width on scroll. Start slightly larger (h-16) and shrink to h-12 when scrolling down to save screen real estate.
5. **Mobile Menu Animation:** Instead of a sudden appearance, slide the mobile menu in from the right side using `transform: translateX()` with a smooth ease-in-out transition.
6. **Progress Bar:** Add a slim reading progress bar at the very top of the page (in `--accent-color`) to show the user how far down the page they are.
7. **Skip to Content:** Add a hidden "Skip to Main Content" link that becomes visible on focus, improving accessibility (UX) for keyboard users.
8. **CTA in Header:** Add a small, outlined "Book a Visit" or "Contact" button in the header (separate from the nav links) for a clear call to action.

### **Hero Section (First Impression)**

9. **Parallax Effect:** Add `background-attachment: fixed` (which you have) but combine it with a slight JS-driven Y-axis translation for the text to create a true depth (parallax) effect.
10. **Scroll Indicator:** Add a "mouse wheel" or "down arrow" animation at the bottom of the hero section to subtly encourage users to scroll.
11. **Text Contrast:** The white text on the hero image needs a stronger gradient overlay. Change the linear gradient to `linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,0.3), rgba(0,0,0,0.6))` to ensure the bottom text pops.
12. **Slow Zoom:** Apply a very slow CSS keyframe animation (`scale(1)` to `scale(1.05)`) to the background hero image to make the site feel "alive" immediately.
13. **Hero Font Weight:** Increase the `h1` font weight slightly or add a slight `text-shadow` to separate the title from the busy background texture.

### **Typography & Readability**

14. **Body Text Color:** Change `--text-color` from `#3D3A37` to a slightly softer `#44403C` (Warm Grey) to reduce eye strain against the off-white background.
15. **Line Height:** Increase `line-height` on paragraph tags (`p`) from standard to `1.8` to give the text a more "breathing," relaxed feel.
16. **Text Balance:** Add `text-wrap: balance;` to all `h2` and `h3` headlines to prevent hanging single words (orphans) on new lines.
17. **Drop Caps:** In the "Our Story" section, use a decorative "Drop Cap" (large first letter) in `--accent-color` and `Playfair Display` font for a storybook feel.
18. **Quote Styling:** Style the quote "They bring us peace and rhythm" in the Cows section with large, decorative quotation marks in the background (opacity 10%).
19. **Font Pairing:** Use the handwriting-style font (e.g., 'Dancing Script' or similar via Google Fonts) for small sub-captions (like "A sanctuary...") to add a human touch.

### **Artistic Visuals & Aesthetics**

20. **Organic Dividers:** Replace straight line section dividers with SVG "torn paper" or "brush stroke" edges to match the rustic theme.
21. **Texture Opacity:** Reduce the opacity of the `subtle-grain.png` background pattern slightly so it doesn't interfere with the clarity of smaller text.
22. **Image Filters:** Apply a global CSS filter `sepia(10%) contrast(105%)` to all images to give them a unified, warm, "sun-kissed" earth tone look.
23. **Soft Borders:** Add `border-radius: 1rem` (rounded-2xl) to all images, but consider using "squircle" or organic blob shapes for the "Meet the Herd" cow portraits.
24. **Vector Map:** Replace the satellite `Map.png` screenshot in the Location section with a custom-styled, illustrated vector map using your brand colors (Green/Terracotta).
25. **Custom Scrollbar:** Style the browser scrollbar to use your `--green-color` for the thumb and `--bg-color` for the track, making it seamless.
26. **Button Gradients:** Instead of flat colors for buttons, use a very subtle linear gradient (e.g., amber-700 to amber-800) to add depth.
27. **Leaf Motifs:** Add absolute-positioned, semi-transparent SVG leaves in the corners of the "Our Farm" section that move slightly on scroll.
28. **Logo Palette:** Incorporate the "Peacock Blue" from your logo (`Logo.png`) as a hover color for links or buttons to tie the branding together better.

### **Interactive Elements (Cards & Carousels)**

29. **Card Lift:** On the "Home Features" cards, increase the hover lift effect (`-translate-y-2`) and add a slight rotation (`rotate-1`) for a playful interaction.
30. **Clickable Cards:** Make the *entire* card clickable in the features section, not just the "Discover..." text (Fitts's Law improvement).
31. **Image Zoom:** On the Plantation Grid (Mango, Banana, etc.), add `overflow-hidden` to the container and `scale-110` to the image on hover for a zoom-in effect.
32. **Caption Visibility:** In the Plantation Grid, the white text on images is hard to read. Add a permanent gradient fade at the bottom of each grid item, or slide the text up on hover.
33. **Carousel Dots:** Add navigation dots (indicators) at the bottom of the Cow Carousel so users know how many slides there are.
34. **Swipe Support:** Ensure the carousel supports "swipe to scroll" on mobile devices (the current code has touch events, but ensure `scroll-snap` is utilized for smoother physics).
35. **Lightbox Background:** When the "Dairy Teaser" lightbox opens, use a blurred version of the current page as the backdrop instead of solid black/70.
36. **Focus States:** Define a custom `:focus-visible` ring using the `--accent-color` (Terracotta) so keyboard navigation looks intentional and matches the theme.

### **Layout & Structure**

37. **Masonry Layout:** For the "Our Farm" plantation grid, consider a "Masonry" layout (staggered height) instead of a rigid grid to feel more organic.
38. **Whitespace:** Increase vertical padding (`py-24` to `py-32`) between sections to create a greater sense of peace and openness.
39. **Asymmetry:** In the "Farmhouse" section (Text + Image), slightly offset the image vertically or overlap the text box onto the image for a more magazine-style layout.
40. **Footer Hierarchy:** Group the footer links into columns (e.g., "Explore", "Visit", "Social") rather than a single horizontal line for better scanning on desktop.
41. **Center Alignment:** In the "Our Story" section, limit the text width (`max-w-2xl`) even strictly to ensure comfortable line lengths (60-75 characters).

### **Mobile Experience**

42. **Touch Targets:** Increase the padding on all mobile navigation links to ensure they are at least 44px tall (easy to tap).
43. **Sticky Call Button:** On mobile only, consider a sticky floating action button (bottom right) for "Get Directions" when in the Location section.
44. **Font Sizing:** Reduce the `h1` size slightly on mobile (`text-4xl` might still be too large for some words). Use `clamp()` for fluid typography.
45. **Horizontal Scroll:** For the Plantation grid on mobile, turn it into a horizontal scrollable strip (with scroll snap) instead of a long vertical stack of images.

### **Micro-Interactions & Polish**

46. **Button Press:** Add a `:active` state to buttons where they scale down slightly (`scale-95`) to mimic a physical button press.
47. **Image Loading:** Add a "blur-up" effect or a skeleton loader (grey pulsing box) while images are fetching to prevent layout shifts (CLS).
48. **Link Underlines:** Animate the underline of links to grow from the center out (`w-0` to `w-full`) on hover, rather than just appearing.
49. **404 Handling:** Even though it's a single page, ensure that if a user tries to access a non-existent anchor (e.g., `#nonexistent`), the page gracefully scrolls to the top.
50. **Favicon Visibility:** The current `Favicon.png` is complex. Create a simplified version (just the peacock feather or just the flute) for better visibility on browser tabs.
